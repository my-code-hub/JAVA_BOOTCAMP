10. Implement a method: (name it "toThePowerOf") which has two parameters (int base and int power) and returns the
   result (base to power). Write a program which asks user to input two whole numbers from and calls
   the method with those numbers and then prints the result of the method.
   For example: if user inputs 2 and 3, the result should be 8 (because 2^3=8).
   You can't use Math.pow() method!

   hint: to implement "To the power of" you can use loop and multiplication. For example,
         2 to the power 3 can be calculated as follows:
         2 * 2 = 4; (first iteration)
         4 * 2 = 8; (second iteration)
         Basically, we will need a variable "sum" where we store the result and then keep multiplying
         it with value power the same amount of times as the value of power.


11. Implement a method which calculates and returns the average number of elements in array.
    Write an example program which uses this method and print out the result.


12. Implement a method (generateArray) which accepts whole number (int size) and creates/returns new array which
    is the size of argument value and populate it with random, positive whole numbers. Write an example
    program which uses this method and print out the result.
    hint: use new Random().nextInt() to generate random number, search google for more info.

    For example, the return value of generateArray(3) could be array which has values 2, 20, 1
    inside.
