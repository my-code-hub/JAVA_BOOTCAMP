1. Ask user to input positive whole number and print the sum for all numbers from 1 to user's input number.
   If user enters negative number, print message "Please enter positive number!"
    hint: use while loop, int sum (sum += i)


2. Ask user to input two whole numbers (first and second) and print out all numbers between first and second.
   (including first and second number).
   If first number is greater than second, then print message "First number has to be less than second."
   and exit program.

   hint: you will need Scanner (for user input), while loop (to print out numbers).
         To exit program, you have to use return; statement. Example:
         if (...) {
             return; //this line stops program execution.
         }


2.1 Ask user to input two whole numbers (first and second) and print out the sum of all numbers
       between first and second. (including first and second number).
       If first number is greater than second, then print message "First number has to be less than second."
       and exit program.


3. declare and initialize array with four arbitrary whole numbers. Print out all of the numbers
   in array. Then ask user to input whole number and assign/change the last element in array to
   what user did input.
   Then print out array again.

   hint: you will need while loop (to print array), Scanner (for user input). See examples:
        ArraysExample, ExampleUserInput


4. declare and initialize array with four arbitrary whole numbers. Print out all of the numbers
   from array in reverse order.

   hint: use while loop. You will have to loop from the last index to first one. See class ArraysExample
