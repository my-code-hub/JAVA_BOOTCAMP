18.1 equals method:
    - create class "Person" with properties "name", "age" and "personalId"
    - create constructor with parameters "name", "age" and "personalId"
    - create getter methods for all of these properties
    - override equals method and change it so instances of type Person would only be equal to
      each other if personalId is equal.
    - write a program which creates a few instances of Person and checks equality between them.
      (example where two persons are equal and not equal)


18.2 Write a program which gets text input from user and outputs the first word and then rest
     of the sentence.
     Example input:
        Sky is blue.
     Example output:
        First word: Sky
        Rest of the sentence: is blue.


18.3 Create new two dimensional array with size 5 x 5. This will be your matrix for multiplication
       table. Fill the array with multiplication table numbers. Print out the multidimensional array.
       Result should look something like this:
           1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
           2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 |
           3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 |
           4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 |
           5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
