1. Implement a method "createSentence" which accepts one argument (array of words) and
   puts words together and returns a sentence (also adds spaces between words).
   Example of the method call:

   String [] words = {"my", "name", "is", "John"};
   String sentence = createSentence(words);
   System.out.println(sentence);
   //It should print: my name is John

   hint: loop trough array of strings the same as you would with numbers. You can put string
         together (concatenate) with + operator, for example:
         String sentence = "text1 " + "text2";
         Similar as we calculated sum for all elements in array of numbers in previous tasks,
         you can create variable of type String and keep adding words to it. And after loop just
         return it.
