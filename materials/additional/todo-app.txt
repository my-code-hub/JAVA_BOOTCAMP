100. Create "TO-DO list management" application which allows the user to:
     1. Add multiple items to the list, for example:
     2. view the list
     3. Remove item from list
     4. Edit any item in the list
          edit 3 buy milk and eggs

     Description: Once the program is launched, it creates list (ArrayList should be used) in memory
        for user and user can interact with program via command line (be entering commands and
        pressing enter). Program needs to support the following commands:

        (note: for all examples below, let's assume we already have two items in our TODO list:
                1 Buy milk
                2 Go to the gym)

        1) printList - command has no arguments, it just prints the list to the user.
            Example input:
                printList

            Example output:
                1 Buy milk
                2 Go to the gym

        2) add [TEXT] - command adds new item at the end of the list and prints the list.
            Example input:
                add Mow the lawn
            Example output:
                1 Buy milk
                2 Go to the gym
                3 Mow the lawn

        3) remove [INDEX] - removes element from list and prints the list.
            Example input:
                remove 2
            Example output:
                1 Buy milk

        4) edit [INDEX] [TEXT] - modifies element in the list and prints the list.
            Example input:
                edit 1 Buy milk and eggs!
            Example output:
                1 Buy milk and eggs!
                2 Go to the gym
