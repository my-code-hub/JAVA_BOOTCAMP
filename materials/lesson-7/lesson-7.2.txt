!Note - you have to use "for" loop in every task.

1. ask user to input positive arbitrary whole number and print Fibonacci sequence till that number.
    For example, if user inputs number 10 the output should be:
    0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34

    hint: use for loop and multiple variables to remember sum and previous values



2. Similar as in first task, but also create new array and save all of the fibonacci numbers in array.



3. Implement a method (printFibonacci) which accepts single argument (int limit) and performs
   the same operations as in task 1
   hint: basically, move the same code you wrote in task 1 inside a method (except the user input part)
