15.1 Create class "OverloadedMethods" with package access and create/implement six overloaded methods
    called "outputVariable" each with one parameter for these primitive data
    types: int, long, double, boolean, String, String []. Each of this method should output the
    parameter value and also it's data type. For example:
        output(5);     //int value - 5
    Create class "OverloadedMethodsProgram" and call all of these methods with arbitrary values.


15.4 Create class "ToDoList" which access modifier public. Add property "list" which is array with
   text elements.
   1. Create default constructor which initializes "list" to a new empty array of size 3.
   2. Create overloaded constructor which has one parameter "size" (whole number) and
      use this variable to create new empty array of that size and assign it to "list"
   3. Make sure property "list" is not accessible directly from other class (it has to be encapsulated).
   4. Create method "add" for adding element to the list. (this method should be accessible publicly)
   5. Create method "printList" which outputs the list. (only accessible on package level)
